# Harper
A companion app to help you better yourself through small everyday acts

## Routines
Everyone has their daily routines that keep them productive and efficient- without these, we wander from activity to activity aimlessly, often leaving work unfinished and projects half-done. Harper provides the kick in the butt many people need on their laziest days to get off social media and do something healthy, useful, or just plain interesting. 

Harper won't track whether you're actually doing what you should be, nor will it punish you in anyway if you feel like having a lazy day, but Harper does offer you ways to reward yourself for doing well: every time you complete an action on time, and when you go through a full routine with a perfect completion rate, you will earn points (how many is up to you), which you can then spend on rewards you define yourself. Did you wake up on time, shower, eat breakfast, and brush your teeth? Maybe you should use those points to reward yourself with an extra five dollars in spending money- or maybe you should keep saving for that video game (you only have 200 points to go!).

## Habits
Habits are actions people take regularly, ones that help them be better people and live healthier lives without thinking about it. Maybe you want to take the stairs more, instead of the elevator. Or you want to save water by turning off the faucet while you brush your teeth. How about volunteering a certain number of hours every month?

Harper helps you build habits by asking every night what you did throughout the day, as well as allowing you to associate habits with routines. Did you choose to take the stairs today over the elevator? You just brushed your teeth- did you turn off the faucet while doing so? At the end of the month, Harper can ask how many hours you volunteered (or you can input it manually as you go). Track your progress in developing a habit, and reward yourself as the habit becomes a more regular activity in your life.
